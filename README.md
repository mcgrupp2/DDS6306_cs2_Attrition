Summary:
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked your data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data. 

I have been given a dataset of employee data to analyize to identify factors that lead to attrition.  The top three factors that contribute to turnover will be identified backed up by evidence provided by analysis. In addition a model will be built to predict attrition, and a model to predict employee salary.
